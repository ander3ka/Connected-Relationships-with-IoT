# Connected-Relationships-with-IoT
Main purpose of code: Connect stakeholders through voice messages transfered through coffee makers
Record and Upload files allow the voice message to be recorded and uploaded to the user's google drive file, where it is saved for future reference or deleted.
Download and play files allow the user to hear the message through their coffee maker at the press of a button. To save space and power on the raspberry pi, the file is deleted after being played.
